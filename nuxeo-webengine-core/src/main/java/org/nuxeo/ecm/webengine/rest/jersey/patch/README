This is patching jersey implementation to be able to register root resources
without using annotations but configuration files.

WebApplicationImpl class was patched by making the method
RulesMap<UriRule> processRootResources(Set<Class<?>> classes) and the field
'resourceConfig' protected

Also the 'final'modifier was removed form the class declaration to be able to subclass it.

The WebApplicationContext was patched to use the patched WebApplicationImpl
type in constructor
