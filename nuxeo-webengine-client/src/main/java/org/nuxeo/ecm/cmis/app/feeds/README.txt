This package is a Nuxeo extension to CMIS. Should be moved in a separate project.

This extension is providing a way to access feeds exposed by a server. These feeds are a kind of persisted queries so ideally these feeds would be provided by the CMIS query collection. 
But for now  the GET method in the CMIS APP interface is ambiguous and there is no mechanism for retrieving persisted queries.
